#A star Algorithm


Reaching a destination via the shortest route is a daily activity we all do. A-star (also referred to as A*) is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution.

In this code, I will focus on how to build A-star (A*) search algorithm using a simple java code.we will use it to find the best way to make a tour on Greece as I am a traveler fun without spending too much money aka by minimizing the path.
